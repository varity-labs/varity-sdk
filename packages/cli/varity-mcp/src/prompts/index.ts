Follow this exact sequence:
1. Read the varity://sdk/patterns resource to understand the project structure
2. Read varity://sdk/database and varity://sdk/auth for the API reference
3. Call varity_doctor to verify the environment is ready
4. Call varity_init to scaffold the project (dependencies install automatically)
5. Define your data model — call varity_add_collection for each entity your app needs
6. Read varity://sdk/ui-components for available components and their props
7. Write the dashboard pages following the CRUD page pattern from the patterns resource
8. Call varity_build to verify everything compiles
9. Call varity_deploy to deploy to production
10. Call varity_open_browser to show the live app

Key facts:
- Database is zero-config — just define collections and use them
- Auth is zero-config — PrivyStack handles everything
- All credentials are auto-injected on deploy
- Use only components from @varity-labs/ui-kit
- The entire backend auto-configures — no manual setup needed`,

Steps:
1. Read the existing project files: src/types/index.ts, src/lib/database.ts, src/lib/hooks.ts
2. Read varity://sdk/database for the Collection API reference
3. Read varity://sdk/ui-components for available components
4. If this feature needs new data, call varity_add_collection to create the collection, types, hook, and page
5. Write or modify dashboard pages using the patterns from varity://sdk/patterns
6. Call varity_build to verify everything compiles
7. Call varity_deploy to ship the update`,

            type: "text" as const,
            text: `Deploy and publish the Varity app${project_path ? ` at ${project_path}` : ""}.

Steps:
1. Call varity_doctor to verify the environment
2. Call varity_build to compile the project
3. Call varity_deploy to deploy to production
4. Call varity_submit_to_store with ${price ? `price $${price}/month` : "your chosen price"} — this opens a browser page; tell the developer to click Submit to finalize the listing
5. Call varity_open_browser to view the live app
6. Share the App Store listing with your client
