> Build, deploy, and monetize production apps from any AI coding tool — Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, ChatGPT, Windsurf, and more.

The Varity MCP Server gives your AI editor the power to scaffold, deploy, and manage full-stack apps with auth, database, and payments included. One server, every AI client, zero commands.

**Browser Usage:** See the [browser usage guide](https://docs.varity.so/ai-tools/browser-usage) for using in Claude.ai or ChatGPT browser
**Quick Start:** Choose your editor below and run one command

## Install

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "varity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@varity-labs/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add varity -- npx -y @varity-labs/mcp
```

### VS Code with Copilot

    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Auth | Transport |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| `varity_search_docs` | Search Varity documentation | No | stdio + http |
| `varity_cost_calculator` | Compare costs vs AWS/Vercel | No | stdio + http |
| `varity_init` | Create a new production app | Yes | stdio only |
| `varity_create_repo` | Create GitHub repo with template | Yes | stdio + http |
| `varity_deploy` | Deploy to production | Yes | stdio + http |
| `varity_deploy_status` | Check deployment status | Yes | stdio + http |
| `varity_deploy_logs` | Read build/deployment logs | Yes | stdio + http |

## Example Prompts

Try these in Cursor Agent mode, Claude Code, or any MCP-enabled AI editor:

**Create & Deploy:**
- "Create a new SaaS app called my-dashboard"
- "Deploy this project to production"
- "Deploy and submit to the Varity App Store"

**Manage & Debug:**
- "Show my deployments"
- "Get the build logs for my last deployment"
- "Why did my deployment fail?"

**Docs & Pricing:**
- "Search Varity docs for database setup"
- "How much would it cost to host a SaaS app with 5,000 users on Varity?"
- "Compare Varity vs AWS costs for my app"

## End-to-End Workflow

From empty folder to deployed, monetized app — all from natural language:

```
You: "Create a new SaaS app called analytics-pro"
AI:  Created analytics-pro with auth, database, dashboard, landing page

You: "Deploy it to production"
AI:  Deployed! Live at https://analytics-pro.varity.app

You: "Submit to the App Store"
AI:  Submitted to the Varity App Store (90% revenue split)
```

## What Makes This Different

| Feature | Vercel MCP | Varity MCP |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Create new apps | No | Yes |
| Auth included | No | Yes |
| Database included | No | Yes (Document Database) |
| Payments included | No | Coming soon (90/10 split) |
| Cost | $20+/mo | ~70% less |
| Open source | No | Yes (MIT) |

## Transports

### stdio (default)

For desktop AI editors — Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, Windsurf.

```bash
npx -y @varity-labs/mcp
```

### HTTP

For browser-based AI tools — Claude.ai, ChatGPT.

```bash
npx -y @varity-labs/mcp --transport http --port 3100
```

Hosted at `https://mcp.varity.so` — connect directly from any MCP client that supports HTTP.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **For deployment**: `pip install varitykit`
